# Sky Q Cloud PVR API Documentation

View the site: https://davwheat.github.io/sky-q-cloud-pvr-api-documentation

Sky have a emulated Sky Q Cloud PVR API available to developers at [35.176.20.130](http://35.176.20.130/).

I have made a copy of all the documentation on this site for archival purposes.

Requests made through the **Try it now!** buttons on this archive are proxied through a Cloudflare worker, then a burner domain, before being forwarded to the Sky Q Cloud PVR. This is to bypass CORS restrictions, and Cloudflare's restrictions on fetching IP addresses via Workers.
